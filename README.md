# calculator-assignment
school project
This is a 'create a calculator school' assignment, i tried to replicate the ios calculator design and add a few shadows.
This is the first project i experienced javascript so it was a fun and more challenging project for me.
Advice, suggestions and changes would be welcome for consideration.
